## Become Sponsor

LestaJS is an open-source JavaScript framework distributed under the MIT license. It is a completely free project that helps many web developers around the world.

However, for our framework to keep up with the latest technologies and tools, we need your support. Community support allows us to continue working toward meeting our users' needs with the best possible quality.

If you can help us even with a small amount, youâ€™ll support not only our team but also everyone who uses Lesta. Every donation is greatly appreciated by our team and helps us grow.
